# tweet-analysis-topic-modelling
In this project, I will explore the world of tweet analysis in the case of two European universities: University of Tartu and Lund University. After extracting and pre-processing, the data will be fully ready for analysis. Furthermore, we are going to be performing topic modelling on universities' twitter data.
