# tweet-analysis-topic-modelling
In this project, I have  explored the world of tweet analysis in the case of two European universities: University of Tartu and Lund University. After extracting and pre-processing,  I have performed some analysis with this data (ex. sentiment analysis). Furthermore, we were going to be performing topic modelling on universities' twitter data.
